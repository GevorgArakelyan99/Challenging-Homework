# Challenging-Homework
Create an application that organizes people's communication:
Each person has their name and age (in years):
Anyone can perform one action: say hello to one of the four other people:
Types of people՝
1) positive, greet the others as follows: "Hello, < <name>>", where < < name>> is the name of the person he greeted
2) the fool greets everyone: "Hi, <<name>>!"
3) a realist, if the age of another person is less than or equal to 5 years, he says: "Hi, <<name>>!", otherwise "Hello, <<name>>":

Assign people's ages to random numbers ranging from 20 to 40 years old and randomly select names from the following list՝
Anahit, Irina, Narine, Armen, Alexander, Aram, Hayk, Silva, Sanasar, Baghdasar:

Write a polymorphic greeting method for each person who receives a Human object that is greeted and returns a greeting string:

The first greets the second, the second greets the first, then the first greets the third, the third greets the first and so on:

Record the results of the dialogues in the "conversation_log.in the "<url>" file, clearly showing who greets whom and how:

As a result, we should have 5 Python files (classes and the main file) and one text file:

Use the basic concepts of OOP and attach a GitHub link to the task.
